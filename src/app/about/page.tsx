          At ArkMercury, fragrance isn’t just a scent—it’s a signature. Born from
          a belief that luxury should be timeless, our mission is to bottle the
          intangible: memory, desire, identity.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-400 text-base">
          We craft bold, genderless fragrances with meticulously chosen notes that
          unfold like chapters in a story. Every blend is an invitation—to reconnect
          with emotion, to stand out quietly, to carry atmosphere with you wherever
          you go.
        </p>
